# Car showcase

**Tech Stack**:
- **Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Headless UI, React.js, and React Icons
- **Backend**: Supabase (for authentication, database management, storage)
- **Rendering**: Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

**Core Features**:
- User authentication (register/login/logout)
- Car listings (view, add, edit, delete)
- File upload for car images
- Search and filter functionality
- Responsive design
- User profile management

**Implementation Overview**:

1. **Setup Project Framework**:
   a. Initialize the Next.js app with TypeScript support.
   b. Install Tailwind CSS for styling.
   c. Set up Headless UI components for accessible UI components.
   d. Include React Icons for visually consistent icons.

2. **Auth with Supabase**:
   a. Configure Supabase client with Next.js environment variables.
   b. Implement authentication pages: sign up, sign in, password recovery.
   c. Create a protected API route that validates Supabase auth tokens.

3. **Supabase Database**:
   a. Define the schema for cars with properties like id, title, description, price, images, user_id, etc.
   b. Implement CRUD operations using Supabase JS library.

4. **Supabase Storage**:
   a. Set up storage buckets for user profile images and car images.
   b. Implement file upload functionality with progress feedback.

5. **SSR & Client-Side Data Fetching**:
   a. Use `getServerSideProps` to fetch initial car listings and authentication state.
   b. Implement client-side data fetching for live updates, search, and filters.

6. **UI Components**:
   a. Use Tailwind CSS for styling the application for a consistent look and feel.
   b. Create reusable components for car cards, forms, modals, etc., using Headless UI.
   c. Implement a responsive navbar and footer.

7. **Search and Filters**:
   a. Build interactive UI components for users to filter cars by make, model, year, price, etc.
   b. Use Supabase functions to query based on user input.

8. **User Profiles**:
   a. Allow users to view and update their profiles.
   b. Include authentication checks to ensure users can only edit their profiles.

9. **Deployment**:
   a. Prepare the app for production by optimizing performance and security.
   b. Deploy the Next.js app to Vercel or another hosting platform that supports SSR.

10. **Optimization**:
     Optimize for SEO by using semantic HTML and meta tags.



Please remember, this is a high-level overview, and you would need to break down each step into detailed tasks when working on the actual project. Good luck with Wild-Oasis!
